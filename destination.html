                    <p>Mars is a planet with a distinctive reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
                        Its diameter is about half that of Earth, with a surface area similar to that of Earth's dry land.
                        The planet has numerous craters, canyons, and volcanic features, including the largest volcano in
                        the solar system, </p>

                    <p>Venus is a planet with a bright and dense atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Venus has
                        a diameter similar to that of Earth, and its surface is rocky and dotted with volcanoes, mountains,
                        and craters. Its dense atmosphere also produces a yellowish-white appearance, with thick clouds that
                        obscure the planet's surface from view. Venus has no moons, and it rotates slowly in the opposite
                        direction to most planets in the solar system.</p>

                        deserts, forests, and more. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace
                        amounts of other gases, and is responsible for producing the blue coloration of the planet. It has
                        one large moon, which is responsible for the tides on Earth. From space,

                        Earth's moon. Its surface is composed primarily of rock and ice, and it has a reddish-brown
                        coloration
                        Pluto also has a system of five known moons, the largest of which,

                    <p>
                        Saturn is a gas giant planet that is best known for its iconic rings, which make it one of the most
                        recognizable planets in our solar system. The rings are made up of countless individual particles of
                        ice and rock, and they stretch out for more than 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the
                        planet's center. Saturn itself is a yellowish-brown color, and it has a distinctive banded
                        appearance caused by the many layers of gas in its atmosphere. The planet is also home to dozens of
                        moons, including the large and icy Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.</p>
