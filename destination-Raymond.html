                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <p>Mars is a planet with a distinctive reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
                    Its diameter is about half that of Earth, with a surface area similar to that of Earth's dry land.
                    The planet has numerous craters, canyons, and volcanic features, including the largest volcano in
                    the solar system, </p>

                <h2>Venus</h2>
                <p>Venus is a planet with a bright and dense atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Venus has
                    a diameter similar to that of Earth, and its surface is rocky and dotted with volcanoes, mountains,
                    and craters. Its dense atmosphere also produces a yellowish-white appearance, with thick clouds that
                    obscure the planet's surface from view. Venus has no moons, and it rotates slowly in the opposite
                    direction to most planets in the solar system.</p>

                <p>Earth is a planet with a diverse and dynamic surface, consisting of mountains, valleys, oceans,
                    deserts, forests, and more. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace
                    amounts of other gases, and is responsible for producing the blue coloration of the planet. It has
                    one large moon, which is responsible for the tides on Earth. From space,

                <p>Pluto is only about two-thirds the size of
                    Earth's moon. Its surface is composed primarily of rock and ice, and it has a reddish-brown
                    coloration
                    Pluto also has a system of five known moons, the largest of which,
                    Charon, is roughly half the size of Pluto itself..</p>

                <h2>Saturn</h2>
                <p>
                    Saturn is a gas giant planet that is best known for its iconic rings, which make it one of the most
                    recognizable planets in our solar system. The rings are made up of countless individual particles of
                    ice and rock, and they stretch out for more than 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the
                    planet's center. Saturn itself is a yellowish-brown color, and it has a distinctive banded
                    appearance caused by the many layers of gas in its atmosphere. The planet is also home to dozens of
                    moons, including the large and icy Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.</p>
